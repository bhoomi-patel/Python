# Selenium = Controls real web browsers programmatically
# JavaScript handling - scrapes content loaded dynamically
# User interactions - click buttons, fill forms, scroll pages

# Memory Trick: Selenium = Selects Elements through Navigation In User Mode!

'''pip install selenium
# Also need to install ChromeDriver or use webdriver-manager
pip install webdriver-manager'''
